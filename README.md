# RESTful File System.

I built this project for my pynas.  It is pretty limited and much of it is still not implemented. If you decide you want to use this, Make sure you use a SSL cert. Authentication is done against the local unix user list.

## Future plans

* Have api operations run as the user you are logged in as.
* Implement upload and delete functions
* Implement the text file edit Save button.
